## Containers

By default, you are allowed to have a single Store instance, globally accessible. However, you might want to have multiple instances of the same Store type. That's where `Container` components come into play. They allow you to create multiple Store instances, making them either global (available app-wide) or local (only accessible to children Subscribers/hooks).

```js
// components/counter.js
import {
  createStore,
  createSubscriber,
  createContainer,
} from 'react-sweet-state';

const Store = createStore({
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  actions: {
    increment: () => ({ setState }) => {
      const currentCount = getState().count;
      setState({ count: currentCount + 1 });
    },
  },
});

export const CounterSubscriber = createSubscriber(Store);
export const CounterContainer = createContainer(Store);
```

The default behaviour of a `Container` is to create a locally scoped Store instance (accessible only to its children) but you can change this behaviour with either of these props:

- `isGlobal`: tells the `Container` to act like a transparent link to the "default" instance, stored in the global registry
- `scope`: is a string that makes the `Container` create (or get) a global instance "prefixed" with that scope id. This allows you to have as many global instances as you need

```js
import { CounterContainer, CounterSubscriber } from 'components/counter';

const App = () => (
  <Fragment>
    <CounterContainer isGlobal>
      <CounterSubscriber>
        {({ count }) => count /* this might be 1 */}
      </CounterSubscriber>
    </CounterContainer>

    <CounterContainer scope={'counter-1'}>
      <CounterSubscriber>
        {({ count }) => count /* this might be 2 */}
      </CounterSubscriber>
    </CounterContainer>

    <CounterContainer>
      <CounterSubscriber>
        {/* this instance cannot be accessed elsewhere */}
        {({ count }) => count /* this might be 20 */}
      </CounterSubscriber>
    </CounterContainer>
  </Fragment>
);
```

The power of `Container` is that you can expand or reduce the scope at will, without requiring any change on the children. That means you can start local and later, if you need to access the same state elsewhere, you can either move the `Container` up in the tree, add the `scope` prop to "link" two separate trees or remove the container altogether.

### Additional features

#### Scoped data sharing

If two `Container`s of the same type have the same `scope` they will share the same data, regardless where they are in the tree.

```js
import { CounterContainer, CounterSubscriber } from 'components/counter';

const App = () => (
  <Fragment>
    <CounterContainer scope={'counter-1'}>
      <CounterSubscriber>
        {({ count }) => count /* if this is 2 */}
      </CounterSubscriber>
    </CounterContainer>

    <CounterContainer scope={'counter-1'}>
      <CounterSubscriber>
        {({ count }) => count /* this will be 2 too */}
      </CounterSubscriber>
    </CounterContainer>
  </Fragment>
);
```

#### Container props are available in actions

Props provided to containers are passed to Store actions as a second parameter [see actions API](../api/actions.md). This makes it extremely easy to pass dynamic configuration options to actions.

```js
const Store = createStore({
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  actions: {
    increment: () => ({ setState }, { multiplier = 1 }) => {
      const currentCount = getState().count * multiplier;
      setState({ count: currentCount + 1 });
    },
  },
});

const App = () => (
  <CounterContainer scope={'counter-1'} multiplier={2}>
    <CounterSubscriber>
      {({ count }) => count /* this will be an odd number */}
    </CounterSubscriber>
  </CounterContainer>
);
```

_NOTE: Remember though that those props will **only** be available to Subscribers/hooks that are children of the `Container` that receives them, regardless of the Container being global/scoped._

#### Container can trigger actions

`Container` options have `onInit` and `onUpdate` keys, to trigger actions and update the state on its props change. The methods' shape is the same as all other actions.

```js
const CounterContainer = createContainer(Store, {
  onInit: () => ({ setState }, { initialCount }) => {
    setState({ count: initialCount });
  },
});

const App = () => (
  <CounterContainer scope={'counter-1'} initialCount={10}>
    <CounterSubscriber>
      {({ count }) => count /* this starts from 10 */}
    </CounterSubscriber>
  </CounterContainer>
);
```

#### Scoped data cleanup

Store instances created by `Container`s without `isGlobal` are automatically cleared once the last Container accessing that Store is unmounted.
